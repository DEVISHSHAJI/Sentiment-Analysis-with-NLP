# Sentiment Analysis with NLP

Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a project that aims to classify the sentiment of textual data into positive, negative, or neutral categories using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models and techniques to analyze and classify sentiment in text data.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of NLP that involves identifying and classifying subjective information within text data. In this project, we implement sentiment analysis using machine learning models trained on labeled datasets to automatically determine the sentiment expressed in textual input.

## Features

- Preprocessing: Tokenization, lowercasing, removal of stop words, etc.
- Model Training: Train machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) on sentiment analysis datasets.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Inference: Perform sentiment analysis on new textual inputs using the trained model.
- Visualization: Visualize sentiment analysis results using plots and dashboards.

## Dataset

The project utilizes standard sentiment analysis datasets such as IMDb movie reviews, Twitter sentiment dataset, or any other relevant dataset containing labeled sentiment data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Sentiment-Analysis-with-NLP.git
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-with-NLP
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and place the dataset (`your_dataset.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

4. Run the scripts in the `src/` directory to preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate model performance, perform inference, and visualize results.

## Usage

- Modify the data preprocessing script (`data_preprocessing.py`) to suit your dataset and preprocessing requirements.
- Choose the appropriate machine learning model and adjust hyperparameters in the model training script (`model_training.py`).
- Evaluate model performance using the evaluation script (`model_evaluation.py`) and adjust the model as needed.
- Use the inference script (`inference.py`) to perform sentiment analysis on new textual inputs.
- Visualize sentiment analysis results using the visualization script (`visualization.py`).

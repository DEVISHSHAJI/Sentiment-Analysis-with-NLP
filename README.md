# Sentiment-Analysis-with-NLP


**Welcome to the "Sentiment Analysis with NLP" project repository! This project is a comprehensive exploration of sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The primary objective is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their textual content.**


Introduction
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to build a sentiment classifier that can categorize movie reviews as positive or negative.

Project Overview
This project follows a structured approach:

#  Data Collection: 
   Utilizing the NLTK library, we gather a dataset of movie reviews, including both positive and negative examples.

# Data Preprocessing: 
  The collected data is preprocessed to extract relevant features, and the most common words are selected as features for classification.

# Model Training: 
  We employ a Naive Bayes classifier to train the model on the preprocessed data.

# Model Evaluation: 
  The trained model is evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy, and additional metrics such as precision, recall, and the confusion matrix are generated.

# Model Saving: 
  The trained classifier can be saved for future use without retraining.
